Python Libraries for manipulating data with maps in their future.

These libraries were written to help in real world applications.

I often find examples written to accomplish a task very verbose. They are not usually very helpful for the real world application I intend to use them on. For that reason I often modify the example (hack) and leave the original largely unchanged. Some of these hacks I have used for years, and I have long forgotten the original source. If you see something here you recognise please tell me the source and I will gladly credit them. Most of the examples are from resources.esri.com but not all.
